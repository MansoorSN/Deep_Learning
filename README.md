1.[Grad-CAM implementation in Keras](https://github.com/MansoorSN/Deep_Learning/blob/master/Grad_CAM_implementation_in_VGG16.ipynb). This implementaion is based on the concept introduced in the paper [Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391).

2.[Talos](https://autonomio.github.io/talos/#/) is a python library used in hyper parameter tuning of the deep learning models. This [notebook](https://github.com/MansoorSN/Deep_Learning/blob/master/talos_hyperparameter_tuning_gh1.ipynb) illustartes how to use Talos for tuning the hyper parameters of a  Neural Network model to train on California Housing Dataset.
