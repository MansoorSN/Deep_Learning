# Deep_Learning
I will be sharing the notebooks as I learn new concepts in Deep Learning.

1.[Grad-CAM implementation in Keras](https://github.com/MansoorSN/Deep_Learning/blob/master/Grad_CAM_implementation_in_VGG16.ipynb). This implementaion is based on the concept introduced in the paper [Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391).
